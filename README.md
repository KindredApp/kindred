# Kindred

> Kindred is a video chat platform that pairs people of varied backgrounds to bridge differences. Each user has a profile with key demographic information used in a proprietary algorithm that pairs different people.  Users are allowed a limited number of pairs per day to ensure meaningful connections.  Discussions are guided by a question of the day to facilitate conversation.  Conversations can be continued via a secure and anonymous messaging system if both parties agree.
